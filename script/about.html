   <h1>The Flavor and Texture</h1>              
   <p>
     Stop into any of our ice cream parlors or peak inside the case at the supermarket, 
     and you will witness the expansive array of flavors, from traditional vanilla 
     and coffee ice creams to somewhat unusual flavors such as sweet basil and sweet 
     potato. But when it comes to gelato, the flavor profile is much more narrow. 
     There are a few classics you'll find in gelato form—vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, 
     and stracciatella (vanilla with crunchy chocolate pieces), as well as pistachio, 
     tiramisu, and a variety of fruit flavors—but not necessarily the type of combinations 
     you see in the ice cream aisle.
